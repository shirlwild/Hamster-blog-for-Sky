  <!- This cube piece of coding was taken from the intro course I did on web design, where I literally wrote what I was told and wasn't sure what I was writing.>
  <!- I have modified the CSS from that lesson to fit this project to create a photo montage>
  <!- I changed the speed of the rotation, opacity, the background from colour to img, resized the background, the alignment of elements>

	<h2 style="font-family: Arial;"> <strong>Introduction</strong> </h2>
	
	<p style="text-align:left; font-family: Arial;"> Meet Misty and Dusty, our pet dwarf hamsters. They have been with us now for 4 months and have caused quite a stir. Originally they were in the same cage but unfortunately Misty is somewhat of a scaredy hamster and irritated her sister so much that we came down one morning to a blood bath in the cage. We then had to seperate the pair. We have had hamster bliss since but not so much space in the house.</p>

	<div id="Misty">
		<h2 style="font-family: Arial;"> <strong>Misty</strong> </h2>

		<p style="text-align:left; font-family: Arial;"> As I mentioned in the intro, Misty is a bit of a nervous hamster. She is also a very fat, lazy and fluffy hamster. She likes nothing more than having a snuggle cuddle and munching away on her peanuts and corn nibbles. She is really rather sweet</p>

	<div id="Dusty">
		<h2 style="font-family: Arial;"> <strong>Dusty</strong> </h2>

		<p style="text-align:left; font-family: Arial;"> Dusty is the energetic of the two of them and often keeps us awake in the night with her squeaking hamster wheel. However, it never wakes Izzy. But then a rocket going off outside her window wouldn't stir her!</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<div id="Care">
		<h2 style="font-family: Arial;"> <strong>How to look after Hamsters</strong> </h2>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;font-family: Arial;">I am by no means the expert on looking after Hamsters, particularly Dwarf Hamsters who are meant to be perfect for children and live in social groups. 
	My daughter is still traumatised from the blood <em>ALL OVER</em> the cage from the night of the attack. </p>
	
		<p style="text-align:left; font-family: Arial;">However there are a few things I have learnt if you care to read on. Or, if you prefer, please see the <a href="http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/pet-talk/pet-care-small-animal-hamster" target="blank"> pets at home </a> link for the professional opinion on how to care for these bundles of fluff </p> 
	
		<p style="text-align:left;font-family: Arial;"> Here is a list of the saliant points I have learnt </p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<ol style="background: white; height: 100px; width: 100%; border: 5px solid black;border-radius: 5px;text-align:left; margin-top:50px; padding-left:50px; padding-top: 20px"> <!-Black isn't working???>
	
      	<li style="font-family: Arial;">Oil the wheels with vegetable oil, it will ensure you sleep like your 6 year old daughter all night</li>
     	<li style="font-family: Arial;">They will always poo when you get them out, normally 2, so make sure you have something light on so you can see them before they fall on the floor</li>
      	<li style="font-family: Arial;">They are blooming fast in the beginning. If you drop one shut all doors and make sure the cats are nowhere near!</li>
      	<li style="font-family: Arial;">Did I mention oiling that wheel? I refer you back to point 1!</li>
    	</ol>
